    <!-- NU1603: Microsoft.xunit.netcore.extensions package has dependencies to versions which aren't published, so ignore those warnings
             NU5105: we're explicitly opting in to semver2, as is most of .NET Core
            CS1701 and CS1702 are by default ignored by Microsoft.NET.Sdk, but if you define the NoWarn property in Directory.Build.props,
            you don't get those defaults.
            SYSLIB0011: Removing binary formatter will happen as part of a larger .NET-wide effort.
            SYSLIB0037 & SYSLIB0044: The deprecated AssemblyName members could require a bigger refactor for us: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7902
            RS0016 & RS0017: Roslyn analyzers seem to be bugged, claiming that API's that exist don't and vise-versa: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7903

            NU1507: There are 2 package sources defined in your configuration. When using central package management, please map your package sources with package source mapping: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/25379
